My story is the same as everyone else's. Just an investment banker moonlighting as a developer. Equally happy to discuss:
- Functional Programming languages and paradigms
- non-profit senior living in the US
- setting up and using text editors
- Strategic Planning

### More Information

Pending...(possibly forever).
