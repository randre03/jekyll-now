I love a good conference talk and currently I am really into the [Elixir Programming Language](https://elixir-lang.org/){:target="_blank"}. One thing though is it's tough to know which talks to watch online:
 - Some have great presenters, but cover a topic I am not currently interested in
 - Some are about a topic relevent to what I'm interested in or need to learn, but the video is poor quality
 - Some just aren't that good

So, I thought I would write about some of the conference talks after I watch them. Let you know what it covers, etc. The format of these reviews is more 'stream-of-consciousness' than 'here's what happened minute by minute record'.

Here is a link to the first one: [Dave Thomas's talk "Power of Erlang, Beauty of Ruby" at 2013 Lonestar Ruby Conference]({% post_url 2017-12-28-conference_talk_review_Dave_Thomas_Lonestar_2013 %}){:target="_blank"}

I'm hoping to keep these coming...
