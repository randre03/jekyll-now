tldr:
 - move you projects into a single `projects` folder
 - move your project-related bookmarks into a `projects` bookmark folder


I am _alyways_ looking for ways to enhance my productivity, reduce complexity and reduce my cognitive load (the burden felt by maintaining and managing what you need to do in your head). I have tried so many different things. TO be honest, I'm not even sure of some of those tactics would have worked or not - after maybe a couple of days or weeks, I stop doing most of the things I have tried. The reasons tend to be one of the following:
 - too much effort to continue the system
 - too much work (at work, home or side-projects) causes me to fall back to my old, comfortable habbits
 - I find the system too rigid and I am unable to fit my needs into that system


One thing I tried was _________' Getting Things Done (INSERT LINK).

I actually liked what it promised:
 - You take everything you are storing in your brain, and dump it out into lists of what you need to do:
   - immediately
   - what can wait (for certain time periods)
   - what you cannot do until someone else does something
   - long-term goals or aspirations

As I said above, I liked what GTD _promised_. But what I found was there was so much stuff I was keeping in my head
 - so my lists were very long
 - and I had to start maintaining lists.

Also, seeing everytihng I wanted to do and had to do was daunting and paralyzing. I quickly adopted, then rejected, GTD.
